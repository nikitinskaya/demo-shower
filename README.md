# Shower Presentation Template
[See it in action](http://shwr.me/).

[Original repo](https://github.com/shower/shower)

This repo is a study project, an attempt to make Shower work with NetlifyCMS.

It makes Shower less customizable, yet allows to create a presentation quickly and without coding (well, mostly).

Usage:

1. Deploy to Netlify

By clicking the button below you can fork this repo and deploy it to Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/nikitinskaya/shower-cms)

 By doing this you would get a GitHub repo linked with Netlify in a way any change to the repo would trigger a shower rebuild and deploy to Netlify servers, which allows for a really easy way to create and share Shower presentation without the need to install anything locally.

2. Go to Netlify admin panel and enable Netlify Identity in Settings, then enable Git Gateway to grant registered users push rights to your site repo. Optionally make registration private and/or add GitHub as external authentification provider to login with your GitHub credentials.
3. Open your newly created Netlify site, go to `/admin`, log in and start creating!
